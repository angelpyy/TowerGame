# Tower of Hanoi
My first ever python project. I'm trying to create a clone of Tower of Hanoi to go along with the recursive code I learned about.

Currently, this project is still severely incomplete and riddled with bugs (one in particular that I am unsure of how to fix). I've worked on it a little more and I'm happy with the progress I've made for my first day.

Here's to eventually being good enough to code this stuff in my sleep. :)
